# Keep your Online Status On Microsoft Teams or Discord
This little ~~Cross-Platform~~ Windows Java program allows you to go away from your Computer but still have a green circle next to your profile.

# How to use the program?
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ReisMiner/Keep-Teams-Online/releases) page and download the latest version.

Make Sure you have at least Java 8 Installed. Download the latest JDK [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

Last step is to execute the Downloaded Jar file, and you are good to go.
